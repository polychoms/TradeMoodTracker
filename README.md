# TradeMood Tracker ðŸ§ ðŸ“ˆ

A minimal and friendly mood tracker for traders â€” especially in crypto or fast-paced markets.

## What it does

- Log your **daily mood** using simple emoji buttons
- Record your **profit/loss (%)** and write short reflections
- Visualize trends over time with a clean, responsive line chart
- Track patterns in your decision-making and avoid emotional traps like FOMO

## Why?

Your trades are emotional â€” so track both the **money** and the **mindset**.

> Be more mindful. Trade smarter.
